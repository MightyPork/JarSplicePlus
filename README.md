History
-------

The tool was originally published in [The Ninja Cave](http://ninjacave.com), but it was abandoned by the original author in 2012, and left without a source code.

[Luis Quesada](https://github.com/lquesada) took the time to decompile it using JAD, and created the [JarSplicePlus](https://github.com/lquesada/JarSplicePlus) repository. This version added command line arguments, and several minor tweaks.

In 2014 [Ondřej Hruška](https://github.com/MightyPork) forked the repo for further development.)
